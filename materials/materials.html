        <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
        <p>The harmful effect that the negative inks and materials have is releasing harmful gasses that can cause people and animals to get sick. This can also cause the soil and water to become polluted. The pollution that is caused by the inks and materials can cause big environmental changes and climate problems. The consequence of printing companies still using harmful materials and chemicals in inks causes even more pollution to the world. This can also result in serious health issues for people and animals.</p>
        
        <h2>Solutions</h2>
        <p>Thankfully we have found better materials and products for us to use. There are better materials and solutions for us to use when printing. There are different types of inks we can use algae-based inks and soy-based or even vegetable-based inks. These inks don't release many harmful gasses or use harmful chemicals. These inks are very easy to break down and less harmful to the environment.</p>
        
        <h2>Recycled Materials</h2>
        <p>There is another solution to use recycled paper that can be made with better materials. This can help the environment and can reduce the number of trees cut down in a forest. This can help protect the forest from even more pollution in the future. When we use recycled paper we get to use the poor qualities of different products.</p>
