            <h2>What is Screen Printing?</h2>
            <p>Screen printing is a versatile printing technique where ink is forced through a mesh screen onto a substrate. While traditionally using solvent-based inks, modern screen printing has evolved to use more environmentally friendly materials and processes.</p>

        <div class="press-section">
            <h2>The Screen Printing Process</h2>
            <ul class="process-steps">
                <li>A mesh screen is coated with light-sensitive emulsion</li>
                <li>The design is transferred to the screen through exposure</li>
                <li>Eco-friendly ink is pushed through the mesh onto the substrate</li>
                <li>The print is dried using energy-efficient methods</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="press-section">
            <h2>Environmental Considerations</h2>
            <p>Traditional screen printing often used harmful chemicals and processes. Modern eco-friendly alternatives include:</p>
            <ul class="press-features">
                <li>Water-based and eco-friendly inks</li>
                <li>Non-toxic cleaning solutions</li>
                <li>Biodegradable emulsions</li>
                <li>Recycled screen materials</li>
                <li>Energy-efficient drying systems</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="environmental-impact">
            <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
            <p>Screen printing has historically been associated with chemical waste and VOC emissions. However, new technologies and materials have made it possible to create high-quality prints while minimizing environmental impact. Water-based inks, improved cleaning methods, and proper waste management have transformed screen printing into a more sustainable process.</p>
