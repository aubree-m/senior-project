            <h2>What is Flexographic Printing?</h2>
            <p>Flexographic printing is a modern form of rotary relief printing that uses flexible photopolymer printing plates wrapped around rotating cylinders. This method is particularly effective for continuous patterns and is widely used in packaging and label printing.</p>
