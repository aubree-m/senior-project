      <p>Solvent inks use pigments instead of dyes, and they are made with oil and alcohol. When handling these inks and
        disposing of them, we must be careful because they release harmful compounds known as volatile organic compounds
        (VOCs). These compounds can adversely affect the environment and contribute to pollution. The printing process
        that uses solvent inks emits gases and involves chemicals that pose serious health risks to both people and
        animals.
        Exposure to solvent-based inks can cause skin and eye irritation, as well as other respiratory. We can reduce
        the environmental impact of hazardous materials. It is important to have a good system to dispose of the inks.
        To make sure not only you and other people get hurt but also our environment and animals.</p>
